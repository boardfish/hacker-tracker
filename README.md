# hacker-tracker
An assistant for documenting hackathons. Show off your team's GitHub profiles and repository, document your work (or otherwise!), and integrate with GitHub and Twitter for a real show of your progress in one day.

# Installation
Seems to run fine on a Ubuntu LAMP stack. ```git clone``` the repository into your web root (/var/www/html as standard). The website will then be accessible from example.com/hacker-tracker/index.php.

# Prerequisites
- MongoDB
- LAMP
